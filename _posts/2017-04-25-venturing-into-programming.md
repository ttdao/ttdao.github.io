My Arduboy just came in the mail today from ACGears and was able to upload my very first 'Hello World' sketch. All is good! 

In the meantime, I'm installing Node.js and Ember.js and see what these frameworks are like. These will be my official step into the programming world ever since I took a JavaScript course at GA. It was definitely tough but I think it was well worth learning how to learn programming. 

My next steps are not only making this site look better but to also see if I can figure out to embed pictures in these blog posts.

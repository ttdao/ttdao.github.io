Starting to fill up these pages with relevant information. Special thanks to Hank Quinlan for free usage of this template for people who like to start using gitpages like me. Just like the first mock post from the template, I should start getting into Jekyll and understand how to use Markdown for these posts. 

Updates:
- Home
- About

Next:
- CV/Resume(?)
- Projects

That's about it!
